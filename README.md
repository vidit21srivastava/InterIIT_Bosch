## Introduction
In this project, we will implement [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) based model that can estimate people's gender and age from a surveillance video feed such as one from a mall, a retail store, or a hospital, while taking into account low quality cameras and cameras placed at a height for surveillance.

## Objective
To build a solution to estimate the gender and age of people from a surveillance video feed (like
mall, retail store, hospital etc.). Consider low resolution cameras as well as cameras put at a
height for surveillance.
